RVL - Example Mappings
===

A set of example mappings using the RDFS/OWL Visualization Language (RVL)

Currently not all of the use cases can be executed, since we are waiting for  the permission to publish 
the example data necessary for the use case or need to clarify whether the data is free to use.


USAGE
===
 - Copy ogvic.properties.template to ogvic.properties (which is git-ignored) and set up your configuration there.
 - Run the JUnit test in the examples package (org.purl.rvl.example)
 - After running the whole transformation process a html file should be available in the  "/org.purl.rvl.tooling.d3vis" project
 
ON ERRORS
=== 
 - Cf. the README in the rvl-interpreter package where the related projects are expected to be stored.
