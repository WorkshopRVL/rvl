This project contains a code generator based on RDFReactor/RDF2GO that creates Java classes for the stateless access of RVL and VISO models. 
Attention, the generated files are put to src/main/java at the moment!


Run VISOapiGenerator and RVLapiGenerator to generate code. Maybe refresh folders after code generation when your IDE cannot find the generated classes.
